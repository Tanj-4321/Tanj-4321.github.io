### Current Projects

#### Soldier Assistant System using Augmented Reality and Machine Learning

The military sector has always been at the forefront of using emerging technological advancements for the purposes of training and combat enhancements.
Because warfare is constantly evolving, armies have to keep up with the newest military “trends” and look for opportunities to get ahead in the technological war. We can solve it using Tactical Augmented Reality (TAR) for Soldier Assistant System (SAS).
